# Zunami Protocol V2

## The First Decentralized Revenue Aggregator

Zunami Protocol is the DAO that works with stablecoins and solves the main issues of current yield-farming protocols by streamlining interaction with DeFi, making it easier and cheaper while increasing profitability by differentiating and rebalancing users’ funds.

## Why we created Zunami Protocol

The technological advancement in the finance area is undergoing a significant reshaping. During the last few years, the overall capitalization of stablecoins skyrocketed. However, the cryptocurrency realm is still regarded as a Wild West, full of traps for new investors interested in making quick profits. Decentralized Finance and stablecoins: the two emerging trends are now combining into a game-changing equation that will benefit tech-savvy users.

The number of users in Yield-farming applications is growing exponentially, but we are still far from market mass adoption. We, the creators of the Zunami Protocol, have identified a number of problems in existing solutions that repel both inexperienced users and hardened veterans of the crypto world. Our goal is to create an application that will break the barrier between traditional finances and DeFi and will be the best solution for stablecoin holders.
